                We are a not-for-profit umbrella organization for open-source projects registered in Australia as a charity. We believe the open-source philosophy provides a resource-efficient channel to transfer knowledge and achieve innovation and education.
              </p>

                Since 2016, we have been mentoring from 10 to 20 students per year within the Google Summer of Code programme. Our selection process is competitive and typically only 10% to 20% of students who apply to be mentored by us are accepted. Most of our alumni become long-term contributors to our projects and to the open-source ecosystem as a whole, and go on to have sucessful careers in the academic world or in the open-source industry.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our organization is open and welcomes contributions from everyone. Browse our project repos and start submitting pull requests.
