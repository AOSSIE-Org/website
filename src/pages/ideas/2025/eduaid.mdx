### Project Type: Large

## Description:

EduAid is an AI-driven tool designed to enhance online learning by generating quizzes from educational content, helping students improve retention and engagement. Currently available as a browser extension, we aim to expand it into a full-fledged platform with a website, optimized model pipelines, and better system performance.  

Our current model supports difficulty-controlled quizzes for short-answer and multiple-choice questions (MCQs). We plan to extend this functionality to other formats, including fill-in-the-blanks, boolean, and match-the-following, by improving our models for diverse question generation. Additionally, we seek to integrate EduAid with other educational platforms to make it a seamless part of the learning ecosystem.

## Expected Outcomes:

- Fully deploy the EduAid browser extension and website.
- Optimize model pipelines for better accuracy and response time.
- Improve system performance for a smoother user experience.
- Expand difficulty-controlled question generation to new formats.
- Enhance UI/UX for better usability.
- Integrate with other educational platforms for wider adoption.
