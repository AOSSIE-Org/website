### Project Type: Medium

## Description:

Agora Blockchain is a decentralized voting platform designed to enhance electoral integrity and accessibility. It enables transparent, tamper-proof voting through smart contracts, leveraging Chainlink CCIP for cross-chain functionality. Agora ensures fair participation and trust in election results by eliminating centralized control and providing a verifiable, immutable ledger of votes.

Key features include:
- **Multi-algorithm voting**: Supports different voting mechanisms like ranked choice, quadratic voting, and stake-based voting.
- **Cross-chain voting**: Uses Chainlink CCIP to enable voting across multiple blockchains.
- **Gas-efficient smart contracts**: Optimized Solidity contracts reduce transaction costs.
- **Decentralized governance**: Community-driven elections and decision-making.
- **User-friendly interface**: Built with Next.js, Wagmi, and MetaMask for seamless interaction.

## Expected Outcomes:

- **Smart Contract Enhancements**:  
  - Implement private elections for confidential voting.  
  - Further optimize election factory contracts for gas efficiency.

- **Cross-Chain Expansion**:  
  - Extend Chainlink CCIP integration to support multiple blockchains.  

- **Frontend & dApp Integration**:  
  - Build an intuitive UI using Next.js and Wagmi.  
  - Ensure smooth wallet connectivity and real-time vote updates.  

- **Analytics & Insights**:  
  - Develop a real-time dashboard for election statistics.  
  - Track voter participation and engagement metrics.  

## Required Skills:

- Solidity  
- Hardhat  
- Chainlink CCIP  
- Next.js  
- MetaMask
