### Project Type: Large

## Description:

In today's digital landscape, personalized content algorithms and social media feeds often create echo chambers of various news and different perspectives and narratives. Users are repeatedly exposed to viewpoints confirming their beliefs. This reinforcement of confirmation bias leads to increased polarization and limits critical thinking. 

The Perspective app tackles the issue of echo chambers and confirmation bias by actively presenting users with well-researched, alternative viewpoints alongside their regularly consumed content. It analyzes the current narrative of a news article, social media post, or online discussion, then curates counterarguments from credible sources. This exposure encourages critical evaluation and helps users see beyond the single perspective they might be constantly fed, ultimately fostering a more balanced and nuanced understanding of complex facts. You don't need to rely on truncated news, get complete facts.


Users can benefit from features such as:
* Counter-perspective: Instantly see counterarguments and narration of why other perspective.
* Reasoned Thinking: The tool will provide a counter-narrative of the same fact with strongly connected facts.
* Updated Facts: With the help of context-aware LLMs, we will provide the latest facts and counter-facts.
* Seamless Integration: Works with news, blogs, and social media applications.
* Real-Time Analysis: You don't need to wait for any author, make Perspective your companion for immediate insights as you browse.

Expected Outcomes:
* Less Bias in narratives: Break out of echo chambers.
* Wider Perspectives: Broaden your understanding of the news you are watching.
* Better Discourse: More balanced discussions.
* Sharper Analysis: Improved critical thinking and decreased your mind's polarisation. 

Required Skills:
* Frontend Development (ReactJS)
* Backend Development (Python, FastAPI)
* AI and NLP (Python, LangChain, Langgraph, Prompt Engineering)
* Database Management (Any VectorDB)
