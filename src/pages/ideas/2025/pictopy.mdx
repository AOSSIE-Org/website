### Project Type: Large

## Description:

Pictopy is currently built using Tauri, relying on Rust, but it comes with platform-specific dependencies that make it difficult to containerize and ship. Electron has been considered as an alternative, but issues with rendering local machine photos and bypassing security have caused challenges in the past. This has led to difficulty in onboarding new contributors as many give up during the setup process, resulting in fewer active contributors.

The frontend needs a **complete revamp** to make it easily packageable, container-friendly, and support the creation of cross-platform executables. Exploring better frontend options like **ReactJS** will simplify development and improve the contributor experience.

The backend has been stable but stagnant and could use refactoring and design enhancements to improve its growth and functionality. While the backend is working without issues, there is potential for optimization and future scaling.

## Expected Outcomes:

- Rework the frontend using ReactJS or other modern frameworks for easier packaging and better DX.
- Explore options to make the app container-friendly using Docker.
- Simplify the process of making platform-specific executables.
- Address issues related to Electron, including photo rendering and security bypassing.
- Increase contributions from new developers by streamlining the setup and packaging process.
- Refactor and optimize the backend for better performance, growth, and scalability.
- Provide design improvements to the backend for smoother development and future expansions.

## Required Skills:

- Rust  
- ReactJS  
- Docker  
- Packaging & Executable Creation  
- Frontend Development  
- Backend Development
