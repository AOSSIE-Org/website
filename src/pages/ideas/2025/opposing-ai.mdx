### Project Type: Large

## Description:

In today's digital landscape, personalized content algorithms and social media feeds often create echo chambers where users are repeatedly exposed to viewpoints that confirm their existing beliefs. This reinforcement of confirmation bias leads to increased polarization and limits critical thinking. 
The AI For Opposing Perspective app tackles the issue of echo chambers and confirmation bias by actively presenting users with well-researched, alternative viewpoints alongside their regularly consumed content. It analyzes the current narrative of a news article, social media post, or online discussion, then curates counterarguments from credible sources. This exposure encourages critical evaluation and helps users see beyond the single perspective they might be accustomed to, ultimately fostering a more balanced and nuanced understanding of complex topics.


Users can benefit from features such as:
* Alternative Viewpoints: Instantly see counterarguments.
* Critical Thinking: Tools for analyzing diverse perspectives.
* Personalized Diversification: Tailored content recommendations.
* Seamless Integration: Works with news, blogs, and social media.
* Real-Time Analysis: Immediate insights as you browse.

Expected Outcomes:
* Less Bias: Break out of echo chambers.
* Wider Perspectives: Broaden your understanding.
* Better Discourse: More balanced discussions.
* Sharper Analysis: Improved critical thinking.
* Reduced Polarization: Encourages open-minded debate.

Required Skills:
* Frontend Development (React Native)
* Backend Development (Node.js, FastAPI)
* AI and NLP (Python, LangChain, Langgraph)
* Database Management (VectorDB)
