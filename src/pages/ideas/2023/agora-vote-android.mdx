Agora Vote App is an Android application that lets user create elections, invite voters, vote and view results. In GSoC’22 we have implemented the Clean-Architecture and Kotlin-Flow :

1. Migration to Jetpack-Compose and Material-You support

3. Share the election results with visualization
4. Implement remaining ballots
5. TDD is preferred but you can write the tests later

## Required Skills:
