### Project Type: Large

## Description:

Pregnancy is a life-changing journey filled with crucial medical appointments, tests, and healthcare decisions. However, expecting parents often struggle to keep track of these milestones, which can lead to missed appointments and added stress. Studies show that adherence to prenatal checkups directly impacts pregnancy outcomes, yet there is no universally accessible tool to assist parents in navigating healthcare requirements based on their country and trimester.

BabyNest is designed to solve this problem through a minimalist React Native app integrated with an AI-powered assistant. This intelligent assistant acts as a personal pregnancy planner and guide, ensuring that expecting parents stay informed, organized, and stress-free.

Users can benefit from features such as:
* Automated tracking of trimester-specific medical appointments
* Country-specific healthcare requirement notifications
* Offline access to pregnancy care guidelines
* AI-powered personalized recommendations and reminders

Expected Outcomes:
* Mobile application built with React Native for cross-platform support
* AI agent integration for intelligent pregnancy milestone scheduling, reminders and tracking
* Offline-first architecture with local storage of healthcare guidelines

Required Skills:
* Frontend Development (React Native)
* Backend Development (Node.js, FastAPI)
* AI and NLP (Python, LangChain)
* Database Management (SQLite, Pinecone)

Mentors:
`Bhavik Mangla`
