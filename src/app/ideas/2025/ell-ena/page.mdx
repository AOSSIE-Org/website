### Project Type: Large

## Description:

Ell-ena is an AI-powered product manager that automates task management by creating to-do items, tickets, and transcribing meetings while maintaining full work context. It is input-agnostic and features a chat interface where users can interact naturally. 

Users can ask Ell-ena to perform tasks such as:  
- "Create a ticket to work on the dark mode feature."  
- "Add a to-do list item for my math assignment."  

The AI understands the context and adds relevant details automatically. Advanced algorithms like Graph RAG can be leveraged for efficient context retrieval and decision-making.

## Expected Outcomes:

- AI-powered system that generates tasks, tickets, and meeting transcriptions.  
- Seamless chat-based interface for intuitive user interactions.  
- Context-aware automation to enrich task details automatically.  
- Implementation of Graph RAG or similar techniques for intelligent processing.  
- Scalable backend to support real-time task creation and management.  

## Required Skills:

- ReactJS / NextJS  
- NodeJS / Any backend tech stack  
- AI / NLP  
- Graph RAG  

## Mentors:
